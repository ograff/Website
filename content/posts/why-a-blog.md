I tend to think that "Blogs" are pretty old fashioned. The days where
everyone had a blogger.com blog are so long ago I probably shouldn't
even be able to remember them. Nonetheless, I decided to make a blog.
The idea came about for a few reasons:

- It would be nice to have a record of what I was working on
  for my own use
- I have a couple of personal projects I'd like to do, that I think might
  be useful for other people to read about
- There are some people I know who I wish had blogs, maybe someone wishes I did
  too

So, I'm going to start trying to write about my tech projects, getting back
in the cockpit, travel (to visit places, and to mileage run), and anything
else that I want to remember / others might find interesting.
