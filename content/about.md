Oliver is a Senior at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Majoring in
Computer Science with a focus on Embedded Systems. Since Sophomore year
of college Oliver has interned at SpaceX every summer, and is looking
forward to starting there full-time in the summer of 2018.

Outside of school and work, Oliver enjoys hacking away on personal
projects, flying (as both a pilot and passenger), skiing, and relaxing
with friends. Oliver wants to get more involved in contributing to
open source projects, and expects this will be easier as school winds
down. Oliver got his Private Pilot Certificate in April of 2016,
and plans to get back in the left seat after moving to LA, with the goal
of becoming an insturment rated pilot.
